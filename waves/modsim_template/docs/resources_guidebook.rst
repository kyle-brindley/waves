Sphinx Documentation
********************

The modsim template uses Sphinx documentation. For more details on using Sphinx, see the main `Sphinx`_ documentation.

The modsim template uses `Sphinx automodule`_ capability. This automatically reads the Sphinx-formatted docstrings
within Python files and adds it to the Sphinx pages where requested.


***
Git
***

The modsim template is already set up to use `Git`_ for version control: a ``.gitignore`` file is included in the main
template directory. By default, it is set up to include file paths and extensions that are not expected to be tracked,
such as the ``build/`` directory, Abaqus or `Cubit`_ journal files, and others.
