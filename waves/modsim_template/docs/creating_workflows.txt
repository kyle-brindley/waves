******************
Creating Workflows
******************

This project uses three layers of SCons configuration files:

1. SConstruct: the project configuration
2. Workflow SConscript: named after the workflow or simulation, e.g. ``rectangle_compression``
3. Part/Assembly SConscript: named after the part, e.g. ``rectangle``

When updating or adding a new workflow, be sure to update the SConscript docstring to match any requirement changes.

SConstruct
==========

The project configuration SConstruct file is responsible for configuring project wide variables, command line options,
and parameter sets. The SConstruct file calls workflow SConscript files with the construction environment export 
named ``env``. For example,

.. code-block::

   SConscript(..., exports={"env": env, ...}, ...)

The SConscript calls are constructed in the ``workflow_configurations`` variable as a list of workflow SConscript
file names.

Workflow SConscript
===================

The workflow configuration SConscript files are named after the workflow, assembly, or simulation that they configure.
These files are limited to pass-through operations calling the correct part and assembly configuration files required by
the workflow and workflow specific tasks. They pass the ``env``, and ``parameters`` through to the part or assembly 
SConscript files.

.. code-block::

   Import("env")

   SConscript(..., exports={"env": env, "parameters": parameters, ...}, ...)

Part/Assembly SConscript
========================

The final layer of SConscript files is the part (or assembly) configuration files. These configuration files should
accept the construction environment ``env``. The project ``parameters`` are imported and unpacked into the part task 
definitions.

.. code-block::

   Import("env", "parameters")

   env.Command(
       target=[...],
       source=[...],
       action=[...],
       **parameters,
   )

The part and assembly configuration files do not define their own alias; instead, the alias is automatically 
constructed from the name of the build directory.
