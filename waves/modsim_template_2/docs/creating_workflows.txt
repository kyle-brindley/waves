******************
Creating Workflows
******************

This project uses three layers of SCons configuration files:

1. SConstruct: the project configuration
2. Workflow SConscript: named after the workflow or simulation, e.g. ``rectangle_compression``
3. Part/Assembly SConscript: named after the part, e.g. ``rectangle``

SConstruct
==========

The project configuration SConstruct file is responsible for configuring project wide variables, command line options,
and parameter sets. The SConstruct file calls workflow SConscript files with the construction environment export 
named ``env``. For example,

.. code-block::

   SConscript(..., exports={"env": env, ...}, ...)

The SConscript calls are constructed in the ``workflow_configurations`` variable as a list of tuples that consist of: (1) 
workflow study name, (2) workflow SConscript file, and (3) study definition dictionary of simulation variables or 
parameter generator object. To maintain a flat build directory, parameter generator set names must match the 
workflow-study name.

Workflow SConscript
===================

The workflow configuration SConscript files are named after the workflow, assembly, or simulation that they configure.
These files are limited to pass-through operations calling the correct part and assembly configuration files required by
the workflow and workflow specific tasks. They pass the ``env``, and ``parameters`` through to the part or assembly 
SConscript files.

.. code-block::

   Import("env")

   SConscript(..., exports={"env": env, "parameters": parameters, ...}, ...)

Part/Assembly SConscript
========================

The final layer of SConscript files is the part (or assembly) configuration files. These configuration files should
accept the construction environment ``env``. The project ``parameters`` are imported and unpacked into the part task 
definitions.

.. code-block::

   Import("env", "parameters")

   env.Command(
       target=[...],
       source=[...],
       action=[...],
       **parameters,
   )

The part and assembly configuration files rely on an explicit alias defined in the SConstruct file and passed down 
through the ``exports={}`` and ``Import()`` interface.

The SConscript files *must* be located in the ``modsim_package`` directory. All project files are located in a single 
``modsim_package``, the workflow and parts SConscript files are re-combined many ways and must be co-located to end up 
with a single build directory per workflow, Abaqus input files are scanned for implicit ``*INCLUDE`` statements so the 
calling workflow SConscript files must be co-located with the Abaqus input files. These restrictions make for large 
and growing ``modsim_package`` directory, so users and developers are encouraged to become comfortable sorting and 
finding files with ``grep`` and ``find`` in a bash command line terminal or seeking out the advanced behaviors for 
file sorting in their preferred GUI file browser.

An example of a workflow configuration may be found in the following files, listed in the SCons configuration order

1. ``SConstruct``
2. ``modsim_package/rectangle_compression-nominal-regression``
3. ``modsim_package/rectangle``

When updating or adding a new workflow, be sure to update the workflow description contained in the SConscript file 
so that the project command line help stays up to date.
