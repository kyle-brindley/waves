This quickstart will create a minimal, two file project configuration combining elements of the tutorials listed below.

* :ref:`tutorialsconstruct`
* :ref:`tutorial_geometry`
* :ref:`tutorial_partition_mesh`
* :ref:`tutorial_solverprep`
* :ref:`tutorial_simulation`
* :ref:`tutorial_parameter_substitution`
* :ref:`tutorial_cartesian_product`
* :ref:`tutorial_data_extraction`
* :ref:`tutorial_post_processing`

These tutorials and this quickstart describe the computational engineering workflow through simulation execution and
post-processing. This tutorial will use a different working directory and directory structure than the rest of the
tutorials to avoid filename clashes. The quickstart also uses a flat directory structure to simplify the project
configuration. Larger projects, like the :ref:`modsim_templates`, may require a hierarchical directory structure to
separate files with identical basenames.
