In ``SConstruct``, the workflows were provided aliases matching the study names for more convenient execution. First,
run the ``nominal`` workflow and observe the task command output as below. The default behavior of `SCons`_ is to report
each task's action as it is executed. |PROJECT| builders capture the STDOUT and STDERR into per-task log files to aid in
troubleshooting and to remove clutter from the terminal output. On first execution you may see a warning message as a
previous parameter study is being requested which will only exist on subsequent executions.
