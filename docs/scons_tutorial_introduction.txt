.. note::

   Unlike the :ref:`waves_quickstart`, this tutorial will use native `SCons`_ code without the `WAVES`_ extensions and
   builders. This tutorial is included as an example for using native `SCons`_ techniques when `WAVES`_ does not support
   required third-party software, such as numeric solvers, or for when a modsim project requires unique builder
   behavior. You can learn more about writing your own `SCons Builders`_ in the `SCons`_ user manual :cite:`scons-user`
   and :ref:`tutorial_writing_builders`.

This quickstart will create a pure `SCons`_, minimal, two file project configuration matching the tutorials listed below.

* :ref:`tutorialsconstruct`
* :ref:`tutorial_geometry`
* :ref:`tutorial_partition_mesh`
* :ref:`tutorial_solverprep`
* :ref:`tutorial_simulation`

The tutorials above and this quickstart describe the computational engineering workflow through simulation execution.
This quickstart uses a separate, standalone subdirectory to avoid file name clashes with the full tutorial files. The
quickstart also uses a flat directory structure to simplify the project configuration. Larger projects, like the
:ref:`modsim_templates`, may require a hierarchical directory structure to separate files with identical basenames.
