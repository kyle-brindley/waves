In this tutorial, the entire workflow is re-run from scratch for each parameter set. This simplifies the parameter study
construction and enables the geometric parameterization hinted at in the ``width`` and ``height`` parameters. Not all
workflows require the same level of granularity and re-use. There are resource trade-offs to workflow construction, task
definition granularity, and computational resources. For instance, if the geometry and partition tasks required
significant wall time, but are not part of the mesh convergence study, it might be desirable to parameterize within the
``SConscript`` file where the geometry and partition tasks could be excluded from the parameter study.

|PROJECT| provides several solutions for parameterizing at the level of workflow files, task definitions, or in
arbitrary locations and methods, depending on the needs of the project.

* workflow files: :meth:`waves.scons_extensions.parameter_study_sconscript`
* task definitions: :meth:`waves.scons_extensions.parameter_study_task`
* anywhere: :meth:`waves.parameter_generators.ParameterGenerator.parameter_study_to_dict`
