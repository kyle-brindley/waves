Before running the parameter study, explore the conditional re-build behavior of the workflow by deleting the
intermediate output file ``rectangle_mesh.inp`` and re-executing the workflow. You should observe that only the command
which produces the orphan mesh ``rectangle_mesh.inp`` file is re-run. You can confirm by inspecting the time stamps of
files in the build directory before and after file removal and workflow execution.
