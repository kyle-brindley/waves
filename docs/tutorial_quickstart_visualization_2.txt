The workflow visualization should look similar to the image below, which is a representation of the directed graph
constructed by `SCons`_ from the task definitions. The image starts with the final workflow target on the left, in this
case the ``nominal`` simulation target alias. Moving left to right, the files required to complete the workflow are
shown until we reach the original source file(s) on the far right of the image. The arrows represent actions and are
drawn from a required source to the produced target. The :ref:`computational_tools` introduction discusses the
relationship of a :ref:`build_system` task and :ref:`build_system_directed_graphs`.
